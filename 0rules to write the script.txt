# script is nothing but a file containing executable commands
# the rules that need to be followed during the creation of the shell scripts
# 1. the shell script file name should have the extension .sh or .bash
# 2. start the shell script with the a shebang line that is #!/bin/bash
# 3. Add proper documentation like 
# # Description: 
# # Author:
# # Date Created:
# # Version: 
# # Date Modified:
# 4. And in the shell scripts only executable content should be added 
# 5. After creating the script assign the executable permissions to the script using 
# # chmod a+x scriptname.sh (this command will assign the executable permissions to all the user group and others)
# 6. Run the script with the absolute path or relative path or shell interpreter 
# # absolute path /home/vagrant/scriptname.sh (just a example)
# # relative path ./scriptname.sh/ (it can be used only when it is inside the folder that it was created)
# # shell interpreter /bin/bash/scriptname.sh (it can be used without the executable permissionsalos)
